# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Riccardo Preite and I'm a student of Computer Science at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) where I'm near to the end of my studies in Computer Science master.
I also got my bachelor's degree in Bologna where I developed, as thesis, an architecture to build web things from API and manipulate existing Things to create simple personal programs: [Open-API-WoT-Architecture](https://github.com/riccardopreite/Open-API-WoT-Architecture).

## On going... ðŸ”­
I'm currently working on my master thesis about a sustainable project at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en).

## Interests ðŸŒ±
In the last period I have started to study many different fields: First I discovered the AI world, thanks also to the double degree program accomplished at [University of Bielefeld](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/), to learn new techniques to use for future project. During the first year of master program I started research about sustainable argument, like Agenda2030 and its applications, and now I moved my sight to learn some frontend framework, like Vue.js. I want to use these three main fields: AI, sustainable and Vue.js to create new mash-up programs that allow users to query AI model, mainly about sustainable projects, by a simple and clean web interface.

## About me ðŸ˜„âœ¨
I would define myself as a person who love to get challenged, discover new things or techniques is something I'm passionated and not only about IT, my favorite hobbies are engine(mechanic) and sports and thanks to them I learned to study the environment around to me and find a way to solve the problem by my own.
